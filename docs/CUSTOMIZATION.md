## Tag System

### Creating Your Tag Taxonomy

#### Hierarchical Tags
```markdown
#work/project/clientA
#work/project/clientB
#work/admin/expenses
#work/admin/planning

#personal/health/exercise
#personal/health/nutrition
#personal/finance/budget
#personal/finance/investing
```

#energy/medium
#energy/low   # Can do when tired
```

#### Context Tags
```markdown
#context/home
#context/office
#context/online
#context/phone
#context/errands
```

### Tag Combinations
Use multiple tags for powerful filtering:
```markdown
#work #priority/high #energy/high #context/office
```

## Skills (Unified Pattern)

In Claude Code v2.1+, skills and slash commands are unified. All capabilities are now skills that can be invoked with `/skill-name` or auto-discovered by Claude.

### Creating Custom Skills

Create a new skill directory with a `SKILL.md` file:

#### Example: Book Notes Skill
Create `.claude/skills/book-notes/SKILL.md`:
```markdown
---
name: book-notes
description: Create book notes with metadata. Use when starting a new book or organizing reading notes.
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob
user-invocable: true
---

# Book Notes Skill

Creates a new book note with metadata and structure.

## Usage
Invoke with `/book-notes` or ask Claude to create a book note.

## What it does
1. Creates note in Resources/Books/
2. Adds metadata (title, author, date started)
3. Includes template for notes
4. Links to reading list
```

#### Example: Meeting Notes Skill
Create `.claude/skills/meeting-notes/SKILL.md`:
```markdown
---
name: meeting-notes
description: Create formatted meeting notes with action items. Use before or after meetings.
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit
user-invocable: true
---

# Meeting Notes Skill

Creates formatted meeting notes with action items.

## Usage
Invoke with `/meeting-notes` or ask Claude to create meeting notes.

## Template Structure
- Date/Time
- Attendees
- Agenda
- Discussion
- Action Items
- Follow-up
```

### Modifying Existing Skills

#### Daily Workflow for Different Schedules
Edit `.claude/skills/daily/SKILL.md` to customize:
- Daily notes folder location
- Template path
- Date format preferences
- Time block structure

## Output Styles

### Using the Productivity Coach

The included Productivity Coach style transforms Claude into an accountability partner:

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Then choose your output style:
/output-style              # Opens interactive menu to select a style
/output-style coach        # Directly activates the coach style

# Example interaction with coach:
# You: "I'm procrastinating on my report"
# Coach: "What's the smallest action you could take right now that would create momentum?"
```

Your style preference is automatically saved to `.claude/settings.local.json` for the current project.

### Creating Custom Output Styles

Create new personality modes in `.claude/output-styles/`:

```bash
# Quick way to create a new style:
/output-style:new I want a style that acts as a technical mentor

# Or manually create files in .claude/output-styles/
```

#### Example: Technical Mentor
Create `.claude/output-styles/mentor.md`:
```markdown
---
name: Technical Mentor
description: Patient technical guidance with learning focus
---

You are a experienced technical mentor who helps users learn and grow. Focus on:

- Breaking down complex concepts into understandable pieces
- Providing examples and analogies
- Encouraging experimentation and learning from mistakes
- Suggesting resources for deeper learning
- Celebrating progress and understanding

Always teach the "why" behind the "how".
```

#### Example: Creative Brainstormer
Create `.claude/output-styles/creative.md`:
```markdown
---
name: Creative Brainstormer  
description: Expansive thinking and idea generation
---

You are a creative collaborator who helps generate and expand ideas. Focus on:

- "Yes, and..." thinking to build on ideas
- Asking "What if?" questions
- Making unexpected connections
- Challenging assumptions playfully
- Generating multiple alternatives
- Embracing wild possibilities before filtering

No idea is too crazy in brainstorming mode!
```

### Modifying the Coach Style

Edit `.claude/output-styles/coach.md` to adjust the coaching approach:

```markdown
# Make it gentler
**Challenge with Empathy**: → **Support with Understanding**:

# Make it more intense
**The ONE Thing Priority**: → **The ONLY Thing That Matters**:

# Add domain-specific focus
## Fitness Coaching Focus
- "What workout will you complete today?"
- "How does this meal align with your goals?"
```

## Workflow Automation

### Morning Routine Automation

Create `.claude/skills/morning-routine/SKILL.md`:
